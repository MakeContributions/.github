## Hi there 👋, we are Make Contributions
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

We are an organization that wants to encourage Github newbies to come and participate in open source projects and contribute more to Github (well, the clue in the name 😉).

### There's plenty to take part in the organizing, check out some of our repositories below:
